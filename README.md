**MEDIA PLAYER APP**
As part of my internship assignment, I was given the task of building a Media Player App that can play audio files from the user’s local storage. The main objective of this project was to understand how to handle media files within an Android application and implement basic playback features such as play, pause, and skip. I used Kotlin as the programming language and developed the app in Android Studio, which provided all the tools and libraries needed to create and test the application efficiently. The app uses Android's built-in MediaPlayer class to handle audio playback, and I also used the Storage Access Framework (SAF) to allow users to browse and select audio files stored on their device.

The app has a clean and simple user interface. It contains buttons for selecting a file, playing the selected audio, pausing the playback, and skipping forward or backward by 10 seconds. Once a user selects an audio file, the app shows the file name on the screen and initializes the media player. I ensured that the app can release resources properly when playback stops or when the app is closed. This helped me understand how to manage memory and system resources efficiently during media playback.

Working on this project helped me learn how to interact with Android’s media framework and how to request user permissions to access local files safely. I also gained experience in designing a functional and user-friendly interface using XML. Overall, this task was a great learning experience for me, and it strengthened my understanding of building practical apps that involve user input and real-time interaction with system components.
